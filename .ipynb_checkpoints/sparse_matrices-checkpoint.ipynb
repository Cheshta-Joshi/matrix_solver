    "## Sparse Matrices\n",
    "In this notebook, we study **Sparse Matrices** and explore ways of handling and solving them. These matrices are commonly found while solving different problems and can take up a lot of unneccessary storage and computation time. We try to find efficient ways of representing these and to find effective solutions to solve them. We would also experiment with **quantum algorithms** like Quantum Linear Solver to compare and find the most effective way of dealing with sparse matrices.  \n",
